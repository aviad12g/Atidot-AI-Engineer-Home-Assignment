# Optimal Contact Cadence

Lead conversion success depends heavily on contact timing and frequency. Research shows the highest conversion rates occur when initial contact happens within 5 minutes of lead submission, with conversion dropping 80% if contact is delayed beyond 30 minutes. Implement automated routing systems that immediately assign warm leads to available agents.

Follow a structured cadence: initial contact (day 0), follow-up if no answer (day 1), second follow-up with educational content (day 3), value-building touchpoint (day 7), and final offer (day 14). After 14 days, transition non-responsive leads to lower-frequency nurture campaigns rather than abandoning them.

Vary communication channels across touchpoints rather than repeating the same method. Start with phone calls (highest engagement), supplement with personalized emails, and use SMS for reminder prompts. Avoid overwhelming leadsâ€”no more than one touchpoint per day and no more than three attempts per channel before switching approaches.

Time contacts strategically: mid-morning (10-11am) and early evening (5-7pm) show the best response rates. Avoid Mondays (busy start-of-week) and Fridays (weekend mindset). For business leads, Wednesday-Thursday mornings optimize B2B engagement.

Track response patterns by segment to optimize cadence. Some leads prefer condensed decision timelines while others need extended education periods before converting.
