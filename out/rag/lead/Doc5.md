# Trial Periods and Introductory Offers

Reducing initial commitment barriers significantly increases conversion rates. Offer 30-day free-look periods where leads can purchase coverage, review policy details, and cancel for a full refund if unsatisfied. This risk-free trial removes decision paralysis and demonstrates confidence in product value.

Introductory discounts create urgency and lower initial cost resistance. First-month-free promotions, 10-15% first-year discounts, or waived setup fees make saying "yes" easier. Structure discounts to reward immediate action: "Sign up this week and receive 15% off your first year" creates time-bound incentive.

Bundle trial offers with added-value services: free policy review from a certified agent, complimentary financial planning consultation, or access to premium customer service tiers during the first 90 days. These enhancements cost little to deliver but significantly increase perceived value.

For skeptical leads, offer staged commitments. Start with minimal coverage at low premiums, then provide easy upgrade paths as trust builds. This foot-in-the-door approach converts cautious leads who might otherwise walk away from larger initial commitments.

Guarantee satisfaction explicitly: "If you're not completely satisfied in the first 60 days, cancel for any reason with zero fees and a full refund." This removes risk perception and signals quality confidence.

Track which trial structures and discount levels optimize conversion versus profitability to find the sweet spot for each customer segment.
