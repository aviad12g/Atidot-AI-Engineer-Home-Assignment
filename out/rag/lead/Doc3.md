# Objection Handling Framework

Common objections—cost concerns, competitor comparisons, timing hesitations, and coverage doubts—can be systematically addressed with prepared frameworks. For price objections, shift focus from premium costs to value delivered: "While our monthly premium is $X, consider that it protects $Y in assets and provides Z benefits."

Use the "feel, felt, found" technique: "I understand how you feel. Many customers felt the same way initially. What they found was..." This validates concerns while reframing perspectives. Provide specific examples or testimonials from similar customers who overcame the same hesitation.

When leads mention competitors, avoid direct criticism. Instead, ask qualifying questions: "What aspects of their coverage are most important to you?" Then highlight differentiators—superior customer service ratings, faster claims processing, more flexible terms, or additional riders included at no cost.

For timing objections ("I need to think about it" or "Now isn't a good time"), create urgency without pressure. Limited-time discounts, special enrollment periods, or rate lock guarantees provide concrete reasons to act now. Alternatively, offer to schedule a specific follow-up call rather than leaving it open-ended, which maintains momentum.

Prepare for technical coverage questions with clear, simple explanations. Use analogies and real-world scenarios rather than policy language to make complex terms accessible and relevant.
