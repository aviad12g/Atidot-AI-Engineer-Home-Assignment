# Agent Outreach Protocols

Personal agent contact remains one of the most effective lapse prevention tools. When customers have an assigned agent, retention rates improve by 40-60% compared to non-agent policies. Agents should proactively reach out to policyholders 30-45 days before renewal dates to discuss coverage needs and address concerns.

For policies showing lapse warning signs (missed payments, reduced coverage, or customer service complaints), agents should initiate contact within 48 hours. Use a consultative approach rather than sales pressure: ask about life changes, financial concerns, or dissatisfaction with service.

Train agents to offer immediate solutions during calls, such as adjusting coverage levels, switching payment frequencies, or exploring discount opportunities. Empower agents with decision-making authority to waive fees or extend deadlines when appropriate.

Track agent outreach effectiveness through call logs, resolution rates, and subsequent retention outcomes. Incentivize agents based on retention metrics, not just new policy sales, to ensure focus on the existing customer base.
