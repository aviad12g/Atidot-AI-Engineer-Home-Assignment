# Seasonality and Lifestyle Coaching

Seasonal patterns and major life events are leading indicators of lapse risk. Premium increases during annual renewals, holiday expenses, or tax season create financial pressure that triggers lapses. Proactively address seasonality by offering temporary premium payment deferrals during high-expense months (December, April) or allowing customers to spread annual premiums more evenly throughout the year.

For lifestyle-related risk factors, implement targeted coaching programs. Smokers face higher premiums but offering smoking cessation support, gym membership subsidies, or wellness coaching can help customers reduce health risks and qualify for better rates. Track customer participation in wellness programs and reward progress with premium credits or coverage upgrades.

Life events (marriage, divorce, job changes, relocation, children) create coverage reevaluation moments. Use data triggers (address changes, beneficiary updates) to initiate policy review calls before customers independently seek alternatives. Position these as service touchpoints rather than sales opportunities.

Educate customers about the long-term value of continuous coverage, including the cost of reapplying with higher age-based premiums or new medical underwriting. Help customers understand that maintaining current policies, even at reduced coverage levels, is typically more cost-effective than lapsing and restarting later.
