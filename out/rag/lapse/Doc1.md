# Grace Period Extension Strategy

Grace periods are a critical retention tool that provides policyholders additional time to make premium payments without losing coverage. When a customer misses a payment deadline, offering a 15-30 day grace period demonstrates goodwill and prevents immediate lapse.

Best practices include sending automated reminders at 7, 14, and 21 days into the grace period via email, SMS, and phone calls. Clearly communicate that coverage remains active during this window but will terminate if payment is not received.

For high-value customers or those with long tenure, consider extending the standard grace period to 45-60 days as a loyalty benefit. Document all grace period extensions in the customer record and use them as opportunities to discuss payment plan options or policy adjustments that better fit the customer's current financial situation.

Monitor grace period utilization rates by customer segment to identify at-risk populations early and deploy proactive retention campaigns before lapses occur.
